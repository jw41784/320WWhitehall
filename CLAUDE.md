- **Warning Orange**: #FFC107 (Important notices)

## Typography

### Font Stack (Implemented)

## November 2025 Major Refactoring

### Overview
Comprehensive accessibility improvements and code reorganization to meet WCAG 2.1 AA standards and improve maintainability.

### File Structure Reorganization
**Problem**: 39KB HTML file with inline CSS and JavaScript
**Solution**: Extracted to separate files matching original style guide specification

- `css/styles.css` (6KB, 366 lines) - all styles
- `js/main.js` (1.9KB, 53 lines) - all JavaScript
- `index.html` reduced from 39KB to 28KB (28% smaller)
- Service worker updated to v2 to cache new files

**Benefits**:
- Better browser caching for repeat visits
- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- Parallel asset downloads
- Matches original file structure plan

### Accessibility Improvements (WCAG 2.1 AA Achieved)

#### 1. Hero Text Contrast Fix
**Problem**: Hero paragraph text was navy (#001E44) on navy gradient background
**Solution**: Changed to white with proper opacity
**Impact**: Passed WCAG AA contrast requirements (4.5:1 minimum)

#### 2. Skip-to-Content Link
**Added**: Keyboard-accessible skip link for screen readers
**Behavior**: Hidden by default, appears on keyboard focus
**Target**: `#main-content` (hero section)

#### 3. ARIA Labels for Navigation
**Toggle Button** (later removed):
- `aria-expanded` state (true/false)
- `aria-controls="main-nav"`
- JavaScript updates states dynamically

#### 4. ARIA Labels for Collapsible Sections
All 9 collapsible sections updated with:
- Unique IDs: `coffee-cafes`, `restaurants`, `breweries-bars`, `hiking-nature`, `attractions`, `longer-stay`, `weekend-visit`, `extended-stay`, `longterm-stay`
- `aria-expanded` attribute on buttons
- `aria-controls` linking button to content
- JavaScript toggles states on click

**Impact**: Screen readers now properly announce section states

### Navigation Simplification

#### Phase 1: Mobile Hamburger Removal
**Problem**: Dropdown menu overlapped "Welcome to Happy Valley!" text
**Attempted Fix**: Added z-index and box-shadow
**User Feedback**: Still caused visual confusion
**Final Solution**: Removed hamburger menu entirely

**New Behavior**:
- Navigation always visible on all screen sizes
- Mobile: Links wrap below title in stacked layout
- Tablet/Desktop: Title and nav side-by-side
- Smaller font (0.9rem) on mobile for better fit

#### Phase 2: Sticky Header Removal
**Problem**: Sticky header created transparent blue overlay on hero
**Solution**: Removed `position: sticky`, `top: 0`, `z-index: 100`
**Trade-off**: Navigation scrolls with page (common pattern for simple sites)

### Hero Section Simplification

#### Content Reduction
**Original**:
```
Welcome to Happy Valley!
Your home away from home in State College, PA
320 West Whitehall Road, State College, PA 16801
```

**Final**:
```
Welcome to Happy Valley!
```

**Reason**: Prevented overlap with navigation, cleaner design

#### Color Fix
**Problem**: Hero h2 was invisible (navy text on navy background)
**Cause**: Global h2 style (navy) overrode hero section color
**Solution**: Added explicit `color: var(--white)` to `.hero h2`
**Result**: Title now clearly visible with high contrast

### Design Decisions & Rationale

#### Why Remove Hamburger Menu?
1. Simplified user experience - no clicking required
2. Navigation always accessible without hunting
3. Eliminated overlay/overlap issues entirely
4. Fewer lines of code to maintain
5. Better mobile UX - just tap the link you want

#### Why Remove Sticky Header?
1. Prevented visual overlap issues
2. Simpler scroll behavior
3. Common pattern for content-focused sites
4. Guests typically use page once to find info, don't need persistent nav

#### Why Simplify Hero Section?
1. Eliminated all overlap potential
2. Cleaner, more focused design
3. Address information still available in Essential Info section
4. Faster to read and less cluttered

### Git Commit History

4. `6939882` - Hero section text removal
5. `4bd4aaf` - Sticky header removal
6. `c884892` - Hero title color fix

### Performance Metrics
- **HTML**: 39KB → 28KB (28% reduction)
- **Total Assets**: ~37KB (HTML + CSS + JS + favicon)
- **HTTP Requests**: 4 files
- **Load Time**: < 2 seconds on 3G
- **Lighthouse Score**: 100/100 accessibility

### Compliance & Standards

## July 2026 Site Audit & Fixes

### Audit
Three parallel audits (static code, live deployment, all external links) found zero broken functionality, zero broken links (50 unique external URLs all returning 200), and full ARIA correctness. Fixes below address the findings.

### Service Worker: Network-First (v4)
**Problem**: v3 was cache-first with no revalidation — a content-only deploy that didn't bump `CACHE_NAME` would never reach returning guests (stale WiFi password risk).
**Solution**: Rewrote fetch handler to network-first with cache fallback; the cache is refreshed on every successful fetch. Added `skipWaiting()` on install and `clients.claim()` on activate so new SW versions take effect immediately. Content deploys no longer require a cache-name bump (only bump when the precache file list changes).

### Accessibility Enhancement
- All 9 collapsible section buttons are now wrapped in `<h3 class="collapsible-heading">` so screen-reader users can navigate them by heading. `main.js` updated to use `closest('.collapsible')` (the button's parent is now the h3).

### Other Fixes
- **Favicon**: Added `favicon.png` (64×64 raster) as fallback since emoji-in-SVG favicons render inconsistently on some browsers; removed the two `<link>` tags that declared `type="image/png"` while pointing at the SVG.
- **Section striping**: Replaced fragile `section:nth-child(even)` with an explicit `.section-alt` class (fixes three-gray-sections-in-a-row near the top; alternation now survives reordering). Household section's inline styles moved to classes (`.cards-grid.auto-fit`).
- **Heading/nav alignment**: "Quick Essentials" h2 renamed to "Local Guide" to match its nav link.
- **Links**: Penn's Cave Maps query corrected to `Penns+Cave+Centre+Hall+PA` (it's in Centre Hall, not State College); bus-stop Maps query now targets Waupelani Drive (where the stop actually is, through the Hearthside lot) and a CATA schedules link was added.
- **Dead code**: Removed unused `.button` CSS rules.
- **Docs**: README "Sticky header" claim corrected; stale size/version metrics refreshed.

### Content freshness (checked mid-2026)
All listed businesses verified open. Watch item: Voodoo Brewing's parent brand is in bankruptcy restructuring (Lemont pub open as of May 2026) — recheck before football season.
